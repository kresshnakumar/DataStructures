1) Initialize integer variables first = 0 and second = 1

2) If n is one then print only 0.

3) if n is two then print first and second values.

4) else Print the first and second values and Repeat the loop form 2 until n

      a) Add the first and second value and store it in a local variable.

      b) Print the local variable.

      c) restore the value of second in first and temp in second.

5) end.

Time Complexity : O(n-2)

Space Complexity : 4 variables
